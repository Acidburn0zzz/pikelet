-- NOTE: Many of these functions could benefit from implicit arguments for
-- improved ergonomics. For example, the identity function could be written as:
--
-- ```
-- id : {a : Type} -> a -> a;
-- id x = x;
-- ```
--
-- This would then allow one to write:
--
-- ```
-- Pikelet> id "hello"
-- "hello" : String
-- ```

||| The polymorphic identity function
id : (a : Type) -> a -> a;
id a x = x;

||| Creates a function that always returns the same value
const : (a b : Type) -> a -> b -> a;
const a b x y = x;

||| Function composition
compose : (a b c : Type) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c);
compose a b c f g x = f (g x);

||| Flip the order of the first two arguments to a function
flip : (a b c : Type) -> (a -> b -> c) -> (b -> a -> c);
flip a b c f x y = f y x;


||| Logical absurdity
|||
||| This type should have no inhabitants - if it does, it's a bug in our
||| typechecker!
false : Type 1;
false = (a : Type) -> a;


||| Logical negation
not : Type -> Type 1;
not a = a -> false;

||| Logical conjunction (Church encoded)
|||
||| You could also interpret this as a product type
and : Type -> Type -> Type 1;
and p q = (c : Type) -> (p -> q -> c) -> c;

||| Introduce a logical conjunction between two types
and-intro : (p q : Type) -> p -> q -> and p q;
and-intro p q x y c f = f x y;

-- FIXME: These don't typecheck - I might have got the definitions wrong, or
-- there is a bug in the type checker!

-- and-elim-left : (p q : Type) -> and p q -> p;
-- and-elim-left p q (pq : and p q) = pq p const;

-- and-elim-right p q (pq : and p q) = pq p (flip const);


||| Logical disjunction (Church encoded)
|||
||| You could also interpret this as a sum type
or : Type -> Type -> Type 1;
or p q = (c : Type) -> (p -> c) -> (q -> c) -> c;

-- FIXME: These don't typecheck - I might have got the definitions wrong, or
-- there is a bug in the type checker!
